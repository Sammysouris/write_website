## Does Right-Handed Writing correlate with superior writing skills?

Investigate, for the first time in the literature, the relationship between quality of handwriting and cerebral lateralization for written language, as the typical pattern of right-hand writing and left-hemisphere language dominance has been suggested to infer cognitive advantages (Groen, Whitehouse, Badcock, & Bishop, 2012). However, advantages related to fine motor skills, such as the ones used while writing, have not been studied to date. The only published study to date on the neural correlates of the quality of handwriting has focused on emergent writing (i.e., 5-6 yrs. olds who are at the beginning of formal handwriting instructions and have not fully developed writing skills yet) (Gimenez et al., 2014). Importantly, this study investigated the direct relationship of handwriting and reading abilities, thus did not focus on cerebral laterality for writing.
