## Will training to write with the non-dominant hand restructure the brain?

Investigate, for the first time in the literature, cerebral laterality for writing in the non-dominant hand before and after training. This will help further elucidate whether the laterality patterns found in our previous studies (e.g., Papadatou-Pastou et al., submitted) include a learned, motor component and will also address questions regarding brain plasticity.
