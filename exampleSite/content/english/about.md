    content : "Marietta Papadatou-Pastou <br> Assistant Professor of 'Neuropsychology – Language Functions' <br>
    My research interests include various aspects of neuropsychology, as well as cognitive neuroscience and experimental psychology. I have also developed an interest in the contributions of neuroscience in the educational process, i.e. in the new field of educational neuroscience. The main focus of my work is on behavioural and brain lateralization (i.e., handedness and brain asymmetry), in healthy adults and children as well as in students with special education needs (students with dyslexia, dysgraphia, hearing impaired students, students in the Autism Spectrum, and students with low or high IQ). I am employing behavioural and brain imaging techniques (functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, fTCD) and I am a member of the Consortium on Language Asymmetry (COLA). I have also worked in neuropsychopharmacology, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural and behavioral effects of antidepressant drug action and of mood induction on autobiographical memory. I am further interested in meta-science, with a special focus on meta-analysis, and fascinated about reproducible research. I am a member of the Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA), where I have also served as an Assistant Director for the Ethics Review Committee. I am also usually happy to collect Greek data for fellow researchers doing cross-cultural work. On the applied side, I am a Research Associate for iConcipio, an online support provider based in London UK. iConcipio has developed an online support system for psycholocal and study skills difficulties faced by students in Higher Education, under the name MePlusMe. Last but not least, I am interested in science outreach, giving talks, writing a column named “Let’s Science” for a8inea.com, and writing short articles in the Greek press. <br>

    content : "Nadia Papadopoulou <br> PhD Student <br>
    During my undergraduate studies in Biology, in the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA), my keen interest in studying the nervous system and behavior grew. Therefore, I proceeded with the Athens International Master’s Programme in Neurosciences, offered by the NKUA, in order to focus on the brain and how its functions are interpreted into behavior. For my PhD, I am pleased to study the lateralization of the brain in the process of written language both in adults and in children with dyslexia and/or dysgraphia, but also how lateralization patterns can be altered after a phonological intervention in children with dyslexia."

    My area of research is brain lateralisation during written language production using functional Transcranial Dopler sonography (fTDC). I am also interested in implementing modern tools for better and more meaningful processing of neuroimaging data."

    content : "Nicholas Badcock <br> Senior Lecturer of Psychological Science, University of Western Australia <br>
    Dr. Badcock completed undergraduate and postgraduate studies at the University of Western Australia (UWA). He spent 11 years as a postdoc including time at Oxford University working with Professor Dorothy Bishop and Macquarie University working with Prof. Geneveive McArthur within the Reading Program of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders. In 2020, he returned to UWA as a Senior Lecturer in the School of Psychological Science. Dr. Badcock is a developmental cognitive neuroscientist, interested in how perceptual and attentional capacities underpin complex functioning such as how cognitive control relates to reading ability. His research focuses on learning difficulties and exceptional development with the aim of contributing to scientific understanding as well as translation for education and intervention. He conducts these enquiries using behavioural psychophysics and neuroimaging techniques (e.g., electroencephalography, functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and functional magnetic resonance imaging)."

    content : "Silvia Paracchini <br> DPhil FRSE FRSB , Reader in Medicine University of St Andrews <br>
    I graduated in Biological Sciences (cum laude) from University of Pavia in 1998 and obtained a DPhil in Human Genetics from Oxford University in 2003. My project, supervised by Dr Chris Tyler-Smith and Prof. Ed Southern involved the development of genotyping methods and screening of large cohorts for genetic associations with prostate cancer and male infertility. I conducted my post-doctoral training in Prof. Anthony Monaco’s group at the Welcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, Oxford University. In 2011 I was awarded a Royal Society University Research Fellowship to set up my group at St Andrews. In 2013 I became member of the Young Academy of Scotland. In 2018 I was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology (FRSB) and in 2019 I became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) and was promoted to Reader. I lead the St Andrews Bioinformatics Unit and I am the co-Director of the the Institute of Behavioural and Neural Sciences."
