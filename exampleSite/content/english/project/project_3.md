## Comparing writing in mobile phones to traditional pen-and-paper writing.

This study aims to investigate, for the first time in the literature, the cerebral laterality for typing using mobile phones versus handwriting. Typing using mobile phones is another widely utilized form of writing that has not received research attention to date.

We have received In Principal Acceptance for the Stage I registered report titled "Cerebral lateralization during handwritten and typed word generation: A functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound study in left- and right-handers." in the "Peer Community for Registered Reports". The data for our study have been collected and are available in its entirety in [OSF](https://osf.io/zert6/?view_only=11f338100ce84a088900a04af325b7ea).
