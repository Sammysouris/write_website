## Do interventions for dyslexia have neurological effects in children?

Previous research (Richards & Berninger, 2008; Shaywitz et al., 2004; Simos et al., 2002) has repeatedly shown that atypical cerebral laterality for reading can shift towards more typical patterns after phonological interventions in children with dyslexia. We aim to investigate whether this cortical reorganization after phonological interventions is coupled with a shift in cerebral laterality for writing.
