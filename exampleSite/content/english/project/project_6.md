## What are the underlying hemispheric laterality patterns in children at risk for dyslexia?

Investigate, for the first time in the literature, the cerebral lateralization of 8-12 year old children with special learning disorders, specifically dyslexia and dysgraphia, which are associated with writing difficulties and for which atypical patterns of cerebral laterality for oral language have been found using fTCD (Illiingworth & Bishop, 2009).
