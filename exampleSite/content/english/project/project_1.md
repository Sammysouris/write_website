## Does the motor component of writing affect our measurements?
The aim of this study is to extend the findings of our recent studies on the cerebral laterality of written language (Kondyli, Stathopoulou, Badcock, & Papadatou-Pastou, 2017; Papadatou-Pastou et al., submitted) by further elucidating the relative contribution of language as opposed to motor activity in cerebral laterality for writing.
