## Does the motor component of writing affect our measurements?
The aim of this study is to extend the findings of our recent studies on the cerebral laterality of written language (Kondyli et al., 2017; Papadatou-Pastou et al., 2022) by further elucidating the relative contribution of language as opposed to motor activity in cerebral laterality for writing. 

We have published our study titled "Exploring cerebral laterality of writing and the relationship to handedness: a functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound investigation." in the scientific journal "Laterality: asymmetries of brain, behaviour, and cognition". You can find the paper in the following [link](https://doi.org/10.1080/1357650X.2023.2284407). You can also find the entirety of our data uploaded in the [OSF](https://osf.io/56vnq/).
