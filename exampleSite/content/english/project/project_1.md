## Does the motor component of writing affect our measurements?
Extend the findings of our recent studies on the cerebral laterality of written language (Kondyli, Stathopoulou, Badcock, & Papadatou-Pastou, 2017; Papadatou-Pastou et al., submitted) by further elucidating the relative contribution of language as opposed to motor activity in cerebral laterality for writing.
