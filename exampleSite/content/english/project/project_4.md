## Will training to write with the non-dominant hand result in a shift in cerebral laterality?

This study aims to investigate, for the first time in the literature, cerebral laterality for writing in the non-dominant hand before and after training. This will help further elucidate whether the laterality patterns found in our previous studies (e.g., Papadatou-Pastou et al., 2022) include a learned, motor component and will also address questions regarding brain plasticity. 

We have submitted our study as a Stage I Registered Report titled "Does cerebral lateralization for handwriting change after training to write with the non-dominant hand? Α 15-day intervention study." in the "Peer Community In Registered Reports".
